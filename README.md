# VisionOS Project ‚Äì ARchitect

## Overview  
ARchitect transforms your space with an AR-powered community for sharing and trying furniture ideas. This is an ongoing semester-long visionOS project (Spring 2025) mirroring functionalities of ARchitect iOS but with enhancements tailored to visionOS's native device support.
Jordan Miao and I are the project lead of both ARchitect visionOS and iOS. You can check out our iOS version here: https://github.com/gtiosclub/ARchitect.


This project leverages **RealityKit, Shader Graph, and Firebase** to create an immersive AR/VR experience on Apple Vision Pro that is operational in both frontend and backend. It integrates **hand tracking, spatial awareness, and real-time 3D interactions** to redefine user engagement in augmented environments.

##  Youtube Demo  
This is a partial demo of the app as we are developing many exciting features at the moment and will frequently update this demo part. 
- This video demos our prototype of allowing user to enter an immersive space from a mixed reality space as an entry point, and then manipulate a piece of furniture in the environment while providing information about it through attachments.

##  Features  
 **Real-time 3D Object Manipulation** ‚Äì Supports grabbing, scaling, and rotating objects via **hand tracking gestures**.  
 **Spatial Audio** ‚Äì Implements **AVAudioEngine** to create a **positional audio** environment.  
 **Custom Shaders through Shader Graph** ‚Äì Uses **Shader Graph** for **advanced lighting and rendering effects** to enrich the user experience.  
 **Performance Optimizations** ‚Äì Uses **RealityKit's Entity Component System (ECS)** and **Instruments** to optimize rendering on Vision Pro.
